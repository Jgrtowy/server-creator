# ***Minecraft server creator and manager***
###### in electron cuz why not!

### Project is in very early beta. If you want to contribute, feel free to do so.

#### I used [this](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/) as template.

# **Disclaimer: I'm currently doing changes to make the app as simpliest as possible. Tutorial below will work for now.**
## **How to run the program**

## **Dependencies**

* Node.js
* npm
* git (optional but highly recommended)
* Minecraft server file
* ngrok account and token (optional)

## **Installation**

To download these files you have 3 options:

a) Run ``git clone https://github.com/jgrtowy/server-creator.git`` (if you have git installed) in command prompt or terminal.

b) Download zip from *"Code"* button on top of github page.

c) Install it through *"Github Desktop*" app (if you have it installed).

After downloading files to destination folder open *"First start.bat"*, this will install dependencies, open up the app and ask you for your ngrok authtoken, if you don't want to use ngrok just click *CTRL+C*.

## **Running**

Open *"First start.bat"* if you're trying to run app for the first time. 

For next step open *"Run.bat"* file and drop downloaded *"server.jar"* into *"server"* folder in root directory. Then click *CTRL+R* to restart app and click **Start** button if you're ready to go.

You can find official server file for selected version on [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) page.

There is advanced settings checkbox below server file selector. Here you can f.e. select min and max ram for server.

## ***More to be coming!***

If you encounter any bugs while using the program, hit *CTRL+R* to reload program, and if they're occuring frequently you can post it at project's Issues tab on Github. I'll really appreciate it! ❤️

### **For forge or fabric**

So, these 2 mod loaders have they're own installation process. I'll write guide to them as I finally finish app. For now you need to follow tutorial put on official sites of them. Sorry for that!

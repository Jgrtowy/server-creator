# ***Minecraft server creator and manager***
###### in electron cuz why not!

### Project is in very early beta. If you want to contribute, feel free to do so.

#### I used [this](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start/) as template.

###### Please don't complain bout' my stupid code.

# **I'm currently making changes to do the app as simpliest as possible. Tutorial below will work for now.**
## **How to run the program**

## **Dependencies**

* Node.js
* npm
* git (optional but highly recommended)
* Minecraft server file
* ngrok account and token (optional)

## **Installation**

To download these files you have 3 options:

a) Run ``git clone https://github.com/jgrtowy/server-creator.git`` (if you have git installed) in command prompt or terminal.

b) Download zip from *"Code"* button on top of github page.

c) Install it through *"Github Desktop*" app (if you have it installed).

After downloading files to destination folder open *"First start.bat"*, this will install dependencies, open up the app and ask you for your ngrok authtoken, if you don't want to use ngrok just click *CTRL+C*.

## **Running**

After running *"First start.bat"* open the installation folder by clicking *"Open server folder"* button in app and put MC server file here.

You can find official server file for selected version on [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) page.

### **WARNING! Do not check *ngrok* if you didn't input your token in First start.bat file**

To run app later use *"Run.bat"*

If you have git installed you can update the app by running *"Update.bat"* file.

If you encounter any bugs while using the program, hit *CTRL+R* to reload program.

### **For forge or fabric**

> gonna write it later

### **Special thanks to [*SaintKappa*](https://github.com/theSaintKappa) who helped me sometimes while writing the program.**

### **TODO:**
* built-in file editor,
* tree file explorer,
* executing commands to running server,
* welcome page with introduction, configuration, etc.
